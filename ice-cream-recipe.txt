What You'll Need:

- 1/2 lb. of bacon 

- About 1 cup of brown sugar 

- 1 pint of heavy cream 

- 1 14 oz. can of sweetened condensed milk 

- 1 tsp. of vanilla extract 

- 1/2 tsp. of maple extract 

- 2 tablespoons of real maple syrup

How to Make It:

1. Preheat the oven to 400 F.

2. Coat both sides of each slice of bacon with the brown sugar. The best strategy is to place the brown sugar on a plate and place the bacon over the top, packing the brown sugar on one side and then flipping. 

3. Place the coated bacon onto a cooling rack that has been sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.  Place the cooling rack over an aluminum foil lined baking sheet.  Bake for about 15-20 minutes, until they the strips of bacon look caramelized and firm. Keep a close watch on them and make sure they do not burn! 

4. Let the bacon cool slightly, so that it is no longer stick and remove it from the cooling rack.  Place on a piece of parchment paper and allow them to continue to cool.  

5. Whip the cream with a whisk, hand mixer, or KitchenAid with the whisk attachment until it forms sturdy peaks, be careful not to whip for too long (it will become butter).

6. Gently whisk the sweetened condensed milk, vanilla, and maple extract into the whipped cream until it is completely combined. 

7.Pour the mixture into a large casserole or baking dish.

8.Chop the candied bacon and sprinkle over the top of the ice cream. Freeze for about 6 hours (make sure it is nice and firm!), drizzle with the maple syrup and serve! After it has frozen you may transfer the ice cream into a plastic container with a secure lid and continue to keep frozen for up to 3 months.
